### About 📝
##### 🔹This is a project to meet my needs in having a page that contains some necessary information in an objective way. Here is included animations in the backgroud with the css; the link opens in a new tab, instead of replacing the current page; it also has a favicon and is responsive. It is a project that meets my expectations and is for personal use.
